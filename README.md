# Materialize_Portfolio
This website is built using Materialize. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this site is to become more familiar with Materialize and some basic structures. I used the Parallax template they had and 
started emptying it out based on what I wanted to see on my own portfolio. I knew that I wanted to add some cards with pictures so that
it previews my work and provides a little summary before you click on them. 

### What is left to be done. 

In no particular order. 

* Create pages to my projects
  * This will require me to redo my project to fit the Materialize framework. 
  * Create the links that will link my projects pages to their individual cards. 
  * Write summaries for each of my projects on their individual cards. 
* Create a form in the _Contact Me_ section.
  * The form will connect to Firebase and hold the data that a user inputs. 
* Change the cropping of the first image of the parallax so that its focus is on the laptop. 
* Link the _Email Me_ button to the form.
